This is a pure HTML and CSS website, which was designed for Bisly, a general purpose discord bot. Bisly was discontinued and taken down from discord in 2021. However the website will keep running as a token of memory.

The site was hosted on https://glitch.com/ from May 2019 to June 2025. After the announcement by Glitch to discontinue their hosting services, the site is now hosted on Github Pages.

Thank you.
